RAPIDSCAN METHOD: held in same location as unispec downfacing foreoptic, scan for approx. 3 seconds 
UNISPEC METHOD: unispec measurements taken in normal direction (downslope to upslope) at normal 5 points + 4 extra measurements between (25 measurements total, except when mistakes made, see Notes column). ""Unispec_NDVI"" column is from the scan taken at the normal point, same place as Greenseeker/Rapidscan measurement. ""SWIPE"" Replicate is calculated from the average NDVI all files in the transect."
