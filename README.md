# Unispec R 

R code for Unispec data correction, QAQC and visualization. This is split into two parts: 

1. UnispecProtocol : process & quality check newly collected data, add to long term data set

2. UnispecRecord : standardize, process, and visualize long term data set

3. Visualizations : shiny application built to explore the ArcticLTER unispec record (2009-present)

Scripts and summary documents currently construction are left in the main directory. 

## Prerequisites

The end goal is for code to be operable by somehow with a little but not much experience of R.  All code is written in R and utilizes the "tidyverse" packages, inspired by the practices & methodology well documented in [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-import.html). 

## Getting Started

Clone the project onto your local machine. 

```
git clone https://github.com/jlaundre/UnispecR.git
```
