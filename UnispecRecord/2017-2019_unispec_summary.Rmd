## Description

This is an R Markdown document. This document provides an overview of the Unispec Data collected by terrestrial RA Ruby An in 2017, 2018, and 2019. 

#### Notes on 2017 Data Collection
Unispec Data was collected approximately weekly. 

On -- the XXX foreoptic broke (Ruby stepped on it). Look for inconsistenies here. 

#### Notes on 2018 Data Collection
Unispec data was collected when weather permitted, weekly if possible. The summer was exceptionally rainy and vegetation was often wet, restricting the possible sampling times. At the end of the season, silver circular tags were nailed to the boardwalk at each unispec location (where line-segment perpendicular to the edge of the plot hit the boardwalk). This location was determined by measuring with a string and measuring tape between the wooden stakes marking each 5m segment of the plot. 

Drone data was collected in 2018 in conjunction with unispec measurements -----; however, this drone data turned out to be unusable due to a calibration error of the drone sensor. 

#### Notes on 2019 Data Collection
Unispec data was collected approximately weekly. The LMAT & MAT sites given highest priority, the historic and wet sedge least so. The Shrub sites were only unispec'd once  On ---- 15 scans were made per plot for comparison purposes. On ---- the default number of scans per plot was increased from 5 to 10 for all sites. It took a couple tries to land on "the most efficient" 10 spots to take the scans, so there is some variability over the course of the summe on where these "additional" measurements were made in each plot. By --- this was standardized. 

#### 2019 Data File Descriptions
The data collected in 2019 is saved in the following 4 files.  

  1. 2019_raw_spu_data.rds
  2. 2019_raw_spu_key.csv
  3. 2019_processed_spu_data.rds
  4. 2019_index_data.csv 
  
Metadata correspondence key of scan (.spu file) to sample location. 

  5. 2019_unispec_coordinate_key.csv (no spu_filename column)
  6. 2019_unispec_file_key.csv (spu_filename column) 
  
  
Summary file for analysis

  7. 2019_reflectance_summaries.rds
